What is a Program?
- It has to allocate memory 
- parse and execute scripts which means read and run commands

JavaScript Engine 
Consists of 2 parts:
- Memory Heap: where memory allocation happens
ex: assiging variables
- Call stack: where your code is read executed, tells you where you are in the program
ex: console logging values 
first in, last out

What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript is a single threaded language that can be non-blocking?
Single threaded means it has only one call stack and only do one thing at a time
