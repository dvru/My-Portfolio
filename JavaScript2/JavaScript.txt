What is a Program?
- It has to allocate memory 
- parse and execute scripts which means read and run commands

JavaScript Engine 
Consists of 2 parts:
- Memory Heap: where memory allocation happens
ex: assiging variables
- Call stack: where your code is read executed, tells you where you are in the program
ex: console logging values 
first in, last out

What is JavaScript?
- JavaScript is a single threaded language that can be non-blocking?
Single threaded means it has only one call stack and only do one thing at a time

StackOverflow:
Is when the call stack gets bigger until it doesnt have any space
ex: Memory leaks

Synchronous programing:
Reading the ladder/line, line by line, waits one by one

Asychronous programming:
send a request, then will respond within time, you can do other things in between.

JavaScript Run-time Environment:
On top of the Engine there is:

WEB APIs:
DOM (document)
AJAX (XLMHttpRequest)
TimeOut (setTimeout)

CallBack Queue:
onClick,
onLoad,
onDOne.
Event Loop
